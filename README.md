This was originally a project for OSCON 2020, which got cancelled due to the pandemic.

In 2021, I did something similar in spirit to what this supposed to be. You can find it in the form of the [`rusty_engine`](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine) game engine and the Road Race [scenario](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/tree/main/scenarios#scenarios) and [reference implementation](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/blob/main/examples/scenarios/road_race.rs).
